This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict sequences of movie ratings based on user interactions. The input to the model consists of the features related to movies watched by a user, and the output is the corresponding ratings for these movies. The model is trained on sequences of 5 records per user, predicting the next 5 ratings.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict a user's rating for a sequence of movies based on their past interactions. The model utilizes an LSTM network, which is particularly well-suited for time series and sequential data, making it a good choice for this task.


## Data Preparation

Before training the model, the data must be preprocessed. The steps involved include:

1. **Sorting Data:** The data should be sorted by `user_id` and `timestamp` (if available) to ensure sequential order.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features should be scaled to a range between 0 and 1.
3. **Sequence Generation:** Create sequences of 5 records per user, with the corresponding 5 ratings as the target output.



## Model

Model Architecture
The LSTM model is designed to take in sequences of features as input and output the corresponding sequence of ratings. The model consists of:

LSTM Layer: Processes the input sequence.
Fully Connected Layer: Produces the final output sequence.


## Training

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, which is appropriate for regression tasks like rating prediction. The Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss.


## Suggested Approach of Using LSTM:

1. **Sequence Data:** Ensure that the input data is sequentially ordered and divided into fixed-length sequences (e.g., 5 records). Each sequence should have corresponding target ratings.

2. **Feature Scaling:** Use a scaler like `MinMaxScaler` to normalize the input features. This helps the LSTM model to converge faster and perform better.

3. **Batching:** During training, use batching to efficiently process the data. Batches should consist of sequences of user interactions.

4. **Model Complexity:** Start with a simple LSTM model and gradually increase complexity (e.g., adding more layers, increasing hidden size) as needed.

5. **Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate the model on a validation set to monitor performance. Use loss metrics like MSE for continuous values.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) to find the optimal configuration for your dataset.
