### 1. **Objective**
We want to improve user engagement and accuracy of reccomendations. 

### 2. **Key Metrics**
Common online metrics for recommendation systems include click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, average watch time, and user retention.
But in our case, since we don't have a system deployed, we are going to use offline evaluation metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error
- Precision and Recall
- F1 Score
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)

### 3. **Variants**
In general A/B testing involves creating 2 groups of control people groups
- **Control Group (A)**: Users receive recommendations from the current system.
- **Treatment Group (B)**: Users receive recommendations from the new algorithm

How to simulate it without live environment? Who knows

### 4. **Segment the Users**
Randomly assign users to either the control group or the treatment group, ensuring that each group is statistically similar.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming user_ids are in the ratings DataFrame
user_ids = ratings['userId'].unique()
np.random.shuffle(user_ids)  # Shuffle to randomize

# Split into two groups
mid_point = len(user_ids) // 2
group_a_ids = user_ids[:mid_point]
group_b_ids = user_ids[mid_point:]

# Create a DataFrame to keep track of which group each user is in
ab_test_groups = pd.DataFrame({
    'userId': user_ids,
    'group': ['A']*mid_point + ['B']*mid_point
})
```

### 5. **Implement the Recommendation Algorithms**
For both the control and the treatment groups, we will apply the respective recommendation algorithms.

```python
def get_recommendations(user_id, group):
    if group == 'A':
        # Code for the current recommendation system
        pass
    elif group == 'B':
        # Code for the new recommendation system
        pass
    return recommended_movies
```

### 6. **Run the Experiment**
Next we would deploy the changes to the live environment ... oh we don't have any ... yeah =(

### 7. **Collect Data**

### 8. **Analyze Results**

```python
from scipy import stats

# Example: Analyze the difference in click-through rate (CTR)
ctr_a = data[data['group'] == 'A']['ctr']
ctr_b = data[data['group'] == 'B']['ctr']

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(ctr_a, ctr_b, equal_var=False)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Statistically significant differences found")
else:
    print("No statistically significant differences found")
```

### 9. **Make Decisions**
Based on the analysis, we should decide whether to fully implement the new recommendation algorithm, make further adjustments, or discard the changes.
